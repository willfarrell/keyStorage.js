# How to contribute
First off, thanks for you interest in contributing. Everyone who uses this repos really appreciates it.

## Issues
Found a bug? Great! Write a sample test or sample call with what it should be returning / doing. 

## Pull Requests
Good pull requests - patches, improvements, new features - are a fantastic help.
They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated commits. If
your contribution involves a significant amount of work or substantial changes
to any part of the project, please open an issue to discuss it first.

Make sure to adhere to the coding conventions used throughout a project
(indentation, accurate comments, etc.). Please update any documentation that is
relevant to the change you're making.

Before commiting besure to open `tests/index.html` to ensure all test still pass. Once all tests pass run `sh Makefile` to compile file for use.

## Pull Request Process
Please follow this process; it's the best way to get your work included in the
project:

1. [Fork](http://help.github.com/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clones your fork of the repo into the current directory in terminal
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<this-repo-name>.git
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd <folder-name>
   # Assigns the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/<this-username>/<this-repo-name>.git
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch to contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your pull request is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/interactive-rebase)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic
   branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream master
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests)
   with a clear title and description.
